# ICARUS (Inspecting Compliance to mAny RUleS)

ICARUS is a multi-agent compliance inspection model built built under NetLogo 5.3.1 (download: https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/5.3.1/). 

The model is applicable to environments where an inspection agency, via centrally coordinated inspections, examines compliance of organizations which must comply with multiple provisions. The model should allow verification of whether inspection strategies that rely on the assumption of different frequency of violations of different provisions are more effective than the often used inspection strategies (Cyclic, random).

A simplified version of the model is described in the article "Inspecting Compliance to Many Rules: an Agent Based Model" (https://doi.org/10.7906/indecs.14.3.1)
